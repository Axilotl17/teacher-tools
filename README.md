# Teacher-tools
A simple tool for teachers to randomly pick students for whatever purpose.

This readme will contain extremely basic instructions on how to use github, so bear with me if this seems extremely obvious. 
    
To use this software, it is currently in the alpha release (meaning it is unfinished.) since it is unfinished we do not yet have a website up for this, you will have to download the HTML file and open it in your browser. here is how to do that.

navigate to the latest release (currently https://github.com/Axilotl17/teacher-tools/releases/latest) and open the Assets section.

from there, download "index.html" by clicking on it. 

navigate to the downloads folder on your computer, and open the file in a browser of your choice.

and enjoy!
